# Power

Power is more than authority or influence. Power is the ability to realize your goals. By this defintion, power is not an 
unworthy objective to strive for. The more powerful you are, the more you are in control of your life and your own destiny.

```
“If you do not create and control your environment, your environment creates and controls you.” — Dr. Marshall Goldsmith

```
“The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.” — Albert Einstein
```
If you are not changing, you cannot grow.
