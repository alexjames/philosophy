### Alain de Botton on sex
```
We can read people's psychological traits in their face. When trying to analyze what turns us on, 
ask "what's missing in us?". That is what fundamentally attracts us. The person we are attracted 
to contains all those pshychological which we are attracted to but are slightly short of.

### Alain de Botton on pessimism
```
"Optimism makes us angry" - Senneca

"The wise will start each day with the thought, "Fortune gives us nothing which we can really own."
Nothing, whether public or private, is stable; the destines of men, no less than those of cities, are
in a whirl. Whatever structure has been reared by a long sequence of years, at the cost of great toil
and through the great kindness of the gods, is scattered and dispersed in a single day. ... We live in
the middle of things which have all been destined to die. Mortal have you been born, to mortals you
have given birth. Reckon on everything, expect everything." - Seneca

We envy people when we feel equal to someone. If they achieve something we have not, we feel depressed.

"Enjoying your work" and "marrying someone you love" are modern philisophical concepts that are at
odds with older thought. A few centuries ago, pleasure was reserved for the weekends via hobbies 
and marriage were agreements of convenience. This was the idea of normalcy. These days, maybe 5%
of the population are happy with their jobs or marriages. So these ideas are at odds with what
normalcy should be, making this generation even more frustrated.

The contemplation of death and the shortness of life allows you to re-assess your priorities.
Life isn't cheerful. That is the Devil's talk.

Nietsiche believed that suffering was important in order to achieve anything of value.
"If you refuse to let your own suffering lie upon you even for an hour and if you constantly 
try to prevent and forestall all possible distress way ahead of time; if you experience 
suffering and displeasure as evil, hateful, worthy of annihilation, and as a defect of existence,
then it is clear that [you harbour in your heart] … the religion of comfortableness. How little 
you know of human happiness, you comfortable … people, for happiness and unhappiness are sisters 
and even twins that either grow up together or, as in your case, remain small together.
